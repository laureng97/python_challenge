Module 3 Python Challenge
This file contains the instructions on where to find my items for module 3 challenge.

There are two separate folders containing assignment files. 
The folder labeled "Pybank" has three items within it. A subfolder labeled "Analysis" that contains the text file labeled "financial_analysis" that prints after the python script runs. Another subfolder labeled "Resources" that contains the excel file (CSV). Then the python script labeled "main" that was created to run the analysis.

The folder labeled "PyPoll" has three items within it. A subfolder labeled "Analysis" that contains the text file labeled "election_results" that prints after the python script runs. Another subfolder labeled "Resources" that contains the excel file (CSV). Then the python script labeled "main" that was created to run the analysis.

Please note that I did have assistance from the instructor on formatting and including items within my code. I also referenced Xpert Learning Assistant for further assistance regarding the code. 

Thanks!
